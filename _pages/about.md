Hi! I’m Oğuz Kağan Hitit, a senior undergraduate student at Koç University, double majoring in Electrical & Electronics Engineering and Computer Engineering, with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence.

My academic and research interests lie at the intersection of generative modeling, explainable AI systems and microscopy. 

I am a research assistant at Helmholtz-Munich & Technical University of Munich under [Prof. Zeynep Akata](https://www.eml-munich.de/people/zeynep-akata), where I investigate constructive interference in model merging and conduct large-scale benchmark studies on state-of-the-art LLM merging techniques. 

Also, At the KUIS AI Center, I work with [Assoc. Prof. Aykut Erdem](https://aykuterdem.github.io/) on generative image models and continual learning, exploring how diffusion and LoRA-based architectures can retain and adapt to new information in image style-transfer over time. 

Earlier in my academic path, I worked at Boston University with [Prof. Vivek Goyal](https://www.vivekgoyal.org/), developing probabilistic algorithms to improve resolution and noise performance in particle-beam microscopy. 

Beyond academia, I am the Co-Founder of [Leagle](https://leagleapp.com/en) — a legal-tech startup based in Turkey. At Leagle, we build LLM-powered specialized agents and a SaaS platform to automate legal workflows, increase efficiency, and assist legal professionals with domain-specific, context-aware AI systems.
